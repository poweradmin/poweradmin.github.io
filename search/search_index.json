Prerequisites PHP 8.1 or higher Composer installed on your system Required PHP extensions: pdo, pdo_mysql/pdo_pgsql/pdo_sqlite See System Requirements for detailed requirements. Installing Poweradmin To install the latest stable version of Poweradmin, you can use the following Composer command: composer create-project --no-dev poweradmin/poweradmin This command will create a poweradmin folder in the current directory, download, and set up Poweradmin without development dependencies. After running the Composer command, you need to create a simple configuration file at inc/config.inc.php with basic database settings. Directory Structure After installation, you should have the following structure: poweradmin/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 inc/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 config.inc.php \u251c\u2500\u2500 lib/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 ... \u251c\u2500\u2500 vendor/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 composer.json \u2514\u2500\u2500 composer.lock Basic Configuration Here is an example of what the inc/config.inc.php file should look like: <?php // Database settings $db_host = 'localhost'; $db_name = 'your_db_name'; $db_user = 'your_db_user'; $db_pass = 'your_db_password'; $db_type = 'mysql'; // or 'pgsql' See Basic Configuration for all available options. SQLite Database Settings If you are using SQLite, uncomment the following lines in the inc/config.inc.php file: // Database settings for SQLite $db_type = 'sqlite'; $db_file = '/path/to/your/sqlite.db'; Important: Ensure proper file permissions and directory location for the SQLite database file. Updating Poweradmin If you installed Poweradmin using composer create-project --no-dev poweradmin/poweradmin , here's how to update it later: Navigate to your project directory in the terminal: cd /path/to/poweradmin If you want to update to a newer version of the Poweradmin package itself, you'll need to modify the version constraint in your composer.json file, then run the update command. For specifically updating just the Poweradmin package: composer update poweradmin/poweradmin --no-dev If the project has specific update instructions, check the documentation or GitHub repository for any additional steps that might be required (such as database migrations). The --no-dev flag ensures that development dependencies aren't installed, keeping your production environment clean, just like when you initially installed the project.

This guide explains how to create and manage Reverse DNS (PTR) records in PowerAdmin for PowerDNS. What are PTR Records? PTR (Pointer) records provide reverse DNS resolution, mapping IP addresses to hostnames. They are used for: Email server verification Security controls and authentication Network troubleshooting Server identification Prerequisites Before creating PTR records, you need: The appropriate reverse zone must exist in PowerDNS For IPv4: Create a zone like 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa for the 192.168.1.0/24 network For IPv6: Create a zone like 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa for 2001:db8::/64 Proper permissions to add records to these zones: You need at least one of these permissions: zone_content_edit_own - To edit zones you own zone_content_edit_others - To edit any zone For creating reverse zones, you need: zone_master_add or zone_slave_add permissions Method 1: Adding Individual PTR Records For single PTR records: Go to the reverse zone's record list (e.g., 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa ) Click \"Add Record\" at the top of the zone edit page Enter the information: Name : The last octet of the IP address (e.g., 42 for 192.168.1.42) Type : PTR Content : The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) this IP should resolve to (e.g., host42.example.com. ) TTL : Time-to-live value (e.g., 86400 for 1 day) Click \"Add Record\" Method 2: Using Batch PTR Records Feature For creating multiple PTR records at once: Access the Batch PTR Records feature: From the top navigation: Zones \u2192 Batch PTR Records From the dashboard: Click the \"Batch PTR Records\" card Complete the form: IP Version : Choose IPv4 or IPv6 Network Prefix : For IPv4: The first three octets (e.g., 192.168.1 ) For IPv6: The /64 prefix (e.g., 2001:db8:1:1 ) Host Prefix : Base name for the hosts (e.g., server ) Domain : Domain suffix for PTR records (e.g., example.com ) Number of IPv6 Records : (IPv6 only) How many records to create TTL : Time-to-live value Priority : Usually 0 for PTR records Click \"Create PTR Records\" Examples IPv4 Example Network Prefix: 192.168.1 Host Prefix: server Domain: example.com This will create 256 PTR records: - 0.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa \u2192 server-0.example.com. - 1.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa \u2192 server-1.example.com. - ...through... - 255.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa \u2192 server-255.example.com.

Basics of User Management Poweradmin implements a permission-based user management system with two primary user levels: Uberusers - Users that can do anything within the interface (administrators) Limited users - Users with restricted permissions based on assigned templates Permission Templates Permission templates were introduced in version 2.0.0 and are built from a set of individual permissions. Each permission allows users to perform specific actions, such as viewing zone contents, editing zones, or creating supermasters. By adding or removing permissions to a template and assigning that template to users, you can control user access rights. Understanding Uberuser Status The user_is_ueberuser permission overrules any other permission the user may or may not have been assigned. It grants full access to all features that would otherwise require specific permissions. This is typically reserved for administrators. Zone Ownership Ownership is a designation that marks users as \"owners\" for specific zones. However, ownership alone doesn't grant any privileges for these zones. The actual abilities are determined by the permissions in the user's assigned template. For example, if a user owns zones but lacks the zone_content_view_own permission, they won't be able to see those zones. Edit Access and Zone Integrity Poweradmin assumes that users with edit permissions for a zone can be trusted with full access to that zone. This is because even partial edit access would allow a user to potentially break the zone's functionality. Therefore, if a user can edit a zone, they're also granted delete permissions. Security Pitfalls Be aware that granting any of these permissions can indirectly give users extensive rights: user_edit_templ_perm templ_perm_edit user_add_new Users with these permissions can potentially create or modify templates to grant themselves user_is_ueberuser rights. Additionally, anyone with root shell access to the server running Poweradmin or the PowerDNS database server effectively has uberuser rights.

While the updates are not automatic by default, the service can be automated through scheduled tasks (like cron jobs) or scripts that periodically check and update the DNS records. This is particularly useful for: Hosting services on a connection with a dynamic IP address Maintaining DNS records for home servers or networks Providing consistent domain name access to systems with changing IP addresses Remote access to home networks or IoT devices Poweradmin's Dynamic DNS implementation offers a flexible API that can be integrated with various automation tools and scripts to keep DNS records up to date. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses through various update methods. Requirements Before setting up Dynamic DNS, ensure you have: PowerDNS server with Poweradmin interface User account with appropriate permissions One of the following clients: Bash shell environment Python 3.x with requests module Perl with LWP::UserAgent module cURL or any HTTP client tool Features IPv4 and IPv6 support (dual-stack) Multiple IP management capabilities: Support for comma-separated IP lists Simultaneous management of multiple A/AAAA records Selective record type updating Intelligent record synchronization: Automatic cleanup of outdated records Database and DNS zone consistency maintenance Optional full sync with dual-stack support Automatic SOA serial updates Support for both Basic HTTP Authentication and query parameters TTL management (default 60 seconds) Verbose response mode for debugging Backward compatibility with legacy clients Available Scripts Backend Components dynamic_update.php - Main server-side script for processing DNS updates, supporting: Single or multiple IPv4/IPv6 addresses Automatic IP detection using 'whatismyip' Comma-separated IP lists Dual-stack updates addons/clientip.php - Server-side script that provides the client's public IP address Client Tools Official client scripts: addons/dynamic_dns_client.sh - Bash client script for updating IP addresses addons/dynamic_dns_client.py - Python client script for updating IP addresses addons/dynamic_dns_client.pl - Perl client script for updating IP addresses You can also use cURL or any HTTP client to update DNS records.
